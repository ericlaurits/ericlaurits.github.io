> ABSTRACT Although the teacher-as-researcher movement has been in
> existence for some twenty years, there is reason to think that
> the majority of class teachers remain uninvolved. What lies
> behind their reluctance? This paper puts forward explanations in
> four main areas: teachers’ professional status; teachers’
> working conditions; teachers’ confidence; and teachers’
> difficulty engaging with outsider’s research methodologies. It
> is suggested that classroom teaching is an all-demanding and
> all-involving task which is excluding of an activity as exacting
> as research. However, it is argued that with appropriate support
> more teachers may become involved in research-like activities
> and thus enable a wider dissemination of their insights into
> children’s learning. Why are class teachers reluctant to become
> researchers?

> If more teachers are to become involved then it seems crucial to

> teachers’ status, teachers’ working conditions, teachers’
> confidence and, lastly, the difficulties that teachers
> experience when they try to integrate outsider research
> methodologies into their day-to-day practice.

> workloads, can be seen, at a deeper level, to be about “building
> up public appreciation of the value of education and the worth
> of the teacher” (Tropp, 1957).

> Hofkins (1994) captures a core element of a teacher’s role when

> performers are on task”.

> Brown (1989) is concerned that outsiders’ models have dominated
> the thinking on teaching in classrooms and asks the question:
> what does classroom teaching look like from a teacher’s
> perspective? She found that teachers work spontaneously from
> their own situations and that this does not tally well with a
> more systematic “define objectives – plan activities – evaluate
> achievement of objectives” approach.

> **Hammersley (1993) suggests that the rigour inherent in most**
> **teacher research approaches could militate against the actual**
> **practice of teaching and the way in which teachers need to**
> **“operate under great pressures of immediacy and complexity” (p.**
> **438). He believes that we should be concerned to raise the**
> **status of teaching as an activity per se and not necessarily**
> **through associating it with research.**

> **Elliott (1991), who has long been a leading protagonist of the**
> **method, draws into question the logic of established action**
> **research ways of approaching issues in schools: When one is**
> **faced with a practical problem, it is better to take the**
> **calculated risk of getting it wrong, and adjusting one’s action**
> **strategy retrospectively, than that of not doing anything about**
> **the problem until one has fully understood it. (p. 24) Elliott**
> **argues that the above approach to classroom problems is more**
> **reflective of the ‘natural logic’ of teachers’ practical**
> **thinking.**

> writers, it seems that many teachers lack confidence as writers

> Teachers continue to hold to the view that research is an
> activity which is done by professional researchers based outside
> schools. Teachers therefore need support in order to see
> themselves as researchers and to see their practice as ‘worthy’
> of research.

> **Many teachers feel the gap between their practice and research**
> **lift off is very wide and video can be a very effective way of**
> **breaching this imagined divide.**
