> Over the years, I found that the message concerning the critical importance of teacher research to good and responsive teaching could not be delivered through mere talk, but instead should be co-constructed through engagement in living the process of problem posing in the teacher education classroom.

>in three institutions of higher education, I have found that teacher education research is often an invisible practice and often not conceptualized as “real” research.

> Teacher education research allows us to theorize from our own
> practices and, in turn, transform them.

> Historically, “teacher action research” and “teacher research”
> have been terms mostly used at the PK-12 level. Yet, embracing
> it fully and visibly in the teacher education realm is important
> because it raises awareness of the critical and transformative
> aspects of teaching and learning. It allows teacher research to
> be made visible and validated beyond the PK-12 realm.

> Bissex and Bullock (1987) highlighted that teacher research is
> not bound by traditional paradigms— teachers (and teachers of
> teachers, also known as teacher educators) are invited to engage
> in research by identifying their questions, documenting their
> observations, analyzing and interpreting data in light of their
> theories, and sharing situated representations with the larger
> community, hopefully shedding light onto other contexts. But
> why? Why would someone add another role to their already complex
> professional lives?

> As Goswami and Rutherford (2009) wrote: At the end of the day as
> teachers, we are often left wondering: Are we doing enough? How
> do we know? These are essential questions that occupy the minds
> and hearts of so many of us when we walk into our classrooms.
> This is the reason we do teacher research. (p. 2) Teacher
> research just isn’t like other forms of research, in part
> because there is no blueprint for how to do it . . . there is no
> single definition for what “it” is. (p. 1).

> According to Freire (1970), for transformative education to take
> place, we must blur the traditionally defined roles of teacher
> and learner. Teachers and learners become teacher-learners and
> learner-teachers. Authority becomes dialectically negotiated.
> This does not imply lack of responsibility

> **Dewey’s notion of teachers as students of learning (1904)**
> **invites teacher educators to engage in teacher research in their**
> **own classrooms.**

> and teaching—and, ultimately, society.

> “While it is easy for teacher educators to affirm that they do
> not have time to engage in action research, it is important to
> not only talk the talk about the value of rethinking teaching,
> but walk the walk by engaging in transformative teaching
> themselves” (Souto-Manning, 2011, p. 108).

> “Our teaching is transformed in important ways because we become
> theorists who articulate our intentions, test assumptions, and
> find connections with practice” (Goswami & Rutherford, 2009, p.
> 3). Simply stated, we become better teachers through teacher
> research.

> While it is true that there is no blueprint, there are, in fact,
> shared characteristics held in common by teacher research and
> other research methods. When engaging in teacher research, the
> challenge becomes choosing among the different methodologies to
> find the one that best serves the specific context and
> particulars. (Goswami & Rutherford, 2009, pp. 1-2)
